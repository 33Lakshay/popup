To promote technology development, acquisition, and joint ventures he organized technology scouting missions overseas, and developed mutually cooperative relations with several counterpart industry associations globally. At present, TMMA is campaigning with Ministry of Textiles and Ministry of Heavy Industries to bring out a “Commercialization Scheme for Indigenously Researched & Developed Technologies or Acquired through Technology Transfer from within the country or overseas”. This will greatly help promote “Make in India” and an “Atmanirbhar Bharat” notion in the mindset of each and every textile entrepreneur in the country.
